# CUSUMrelsurv

This repository constitutes all functions that are needed for the simulation examples in "Monitoring time to event in medical registry data using CUSUMs based on excess hazard models" (Tran, Kvaløy and Körner, 2024) wrapped in a package for simplicity. 

The package can be installed by by simply writing the following (depending if one uses `remotes` or `devtools`):

`devtools::install_github("https://github.com/jihut/CUSUMrelsurv")`
`remotes::install_github("jihut/CUSUMrelsurv")`

Some comments about the functions are given in the script files. Otherwise, we refer to the repository containing the simulations https://github.com/jihut/cusum_relative_survival_simulations for explicit examples of how to use the functions included in this package.
